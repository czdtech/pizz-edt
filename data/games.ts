      overview: '2048 is a classic number puzzle game created by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. The goal is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is simple to learn but difficult to master, requiring strategic thinking and forward planning to achieve high scores.',
      howToPlay: 'Use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or WASD keys to move all number tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one larger number. After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) randomly appears in an empty spot. The goal is to create the 2048 tile, but you can continue playing to achieve higher scores.',
      tips: '1. Keep your highest number in a corner: Choose one corner (usually bottom-right) as the permanent position for your largest tile. 2. Build number chains: Try to arrange numbers in descending order to facilitate merging. 3. Avoid random moves: Consider the consequences of each move to avoid breaking your established structure. 4. Keep one row or column as a merging lane: Leave space for smaller numbers to combine. 5. Don\'t rush to merge: Sometimes waiting for a better opportunity is more beneficial than immediate merging.',
      faq: 'Q: What are the game over conditions? A: The game ends when the 4x4 grid is full and no more merges are possible. Q: What\'s the highest possible score? A: Theoretically unlimited, but continuing after reaching 2048 becomes extremely difficult. Q: Is there an undo function? A: The original game has no undo feature - each move must be carefully considered. Q: What\'s the probability of new tiles? A: 90% chance for a 2 tile, 10% chance for a 4 tile.'
