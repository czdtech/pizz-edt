# Site Configuration
# This file shows the available environment variables
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development

# Site URL - Optional, will auto-detect if not set
# For local development: http://localhost:3000
# For production: https://yourdomain.com
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://pizzaedition.com

# The application will automatically detect:
# - Netlify deployments (uses NETLIFY, URL, DEPLOY_PRIME_URL env vars)
# - Vercel deployments (uses VERCEL, VERCEL_URL, VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL env vars)
# - Browser environment (uses window.location)
# - Falls back to https://pizzaedition.com if none detected

# Platform-specific automatic detection:
#
# Netlify:
# - Production: Uses URL environment variable
# - Branch deploys: Uses DEPLOY_PRIME_URL environment variable
#
# Vercel:
# - Production with custom domain: Uses VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL
# - Default deployment: Uses VERCEL_URL (e.g., your-app-abc123.vercel.app)
# - Preview deployments: Uses VERCEL_URL for branch-specific URLs
